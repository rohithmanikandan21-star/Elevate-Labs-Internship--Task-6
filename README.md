# Elevate-Labs-Internship--Task-6
Task 6
1.Open passwordmeter.com in your webrowser
2.Now try entering differnt variations of passwords. like example try with only lowercase then use only uppercase, upper+lower.....
3.In each variation you get the score and feedbacks for that particular password. Example for a password with just lower case, you get the score of 20%. And it shows a feedback telling you to use uppercase, symbols and numbers
4.Now I have tried to create password with the best combination using lowercase,uppercase,symbol and number. and the scoreis 90%-100%
5.Tips i learned from the evaluvation is that, try to avoid setting password with your first name or any personal name. because it is easy to crack by the people who knows you very well. And always use the best combinations to create a password
6.Common Password Attacks are:
           1.Brute Force Attack- Trying every possible password until one works.
           2.Dictionary Attack- Trying passwords from a precompiled list of common words, phrases and leaked passwords.
           3.Password-Spraying- Trying a small set of common passwords (e.g., “Password123”, “Summer2024”) across many user accounts to avoid lockouts.
           4.Credential Stuffing- Using username/password pairs leaked from one breach to access other services where users reused credentials.

7.How password complexity affects security;
          1.Simple passwords (short, common words, predictable patterns like 123456 or qwerty) are easy to break with dictionary, brute-force, or credential-stuffing attacks.
          2.Adding length + variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, unpredictable phrases) increases the total possible combinations, making brute-force and dictionary attacks far less practical.
          3.A long passphrase (e.g., 3–4 random words) can often be stronger and easier to remember than a short, complex-looking password.
          4.In short: longer + more random = exponentially stronger, which raises the attacker’s required time, cost, and computing power to crack it.
